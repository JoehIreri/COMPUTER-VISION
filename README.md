# Parking Lot Occupancy Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect the occupancy status of a parking lot by analyzing images or video frames from surveillance cameras. The system determines whether parking spaces are empty or occupied, helping users find available parking spots more efficiently.

## Features

- Parking lot occupancy status detection.
- Visualization of detected contours on the parking lot image.
- Easy integration with surveillance camera feeds.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Numpy (`pip install numpy`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

3. Run the detection script:

4. View the results:

    The script will display whether the parking lot is empty or occupied, and it will show the original image with drawn contours indicating detected objects.

## Configuration

- **occupancy_threshold:** Adjust this threshold to control the sensitivity of occupancy detection.
